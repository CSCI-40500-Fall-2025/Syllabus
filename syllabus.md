## Course Description

This course is an introductory survey on the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie current and emerging methods, tools, and techniques for the efficient engineering of high-quality software systems. This may include the understanding and appreciation of problems in large-scale software development such as functional analysis of information processing systems, system design concepts, timing estimates, documentation, and system testing.

Software Engineering (SE) is concerned with all facets of software development, from the early stages of requirements engineering to maintaining the system after it has been deployed. This includes technical processes of software development as well as activities such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to support software development. This course is not a "programming" course per se, instead, it focuses on surveying some of the critical facets of SE that may be less familiar to students of Computer Science, such as identifying a development process appropriate to the circumstances, eliciting and documenting requirements, using reviews and inspections plus machine-based testing in software development, understanding software evolution in large, complex systems, issues associated with developing dependable software systems, and configuration management of large systems developed by multiple engineers.

## Credit/No Credit Policy &amp; Special Enrollment Permission

The instructor will not approve C/NC requests for this course. However, such requests may be approved by the college on a per-semester basis; students are encouraged to check the college policies. Students are also encouraged to discuss these options with their academic advisors. Special enrollment permissions, e.g., prerequisite waivers, will not be granted without substantial supporting evidence, e.g., sufficient professional experience.

## Organization

### Lectures

The instructor will post lecture slides for each chapter.

### Reading

The instructor will post a corresponding reading assignment for each chapter.

### Lab

Students work together with their lab partners on a semester-long project.

### Homework

Homework will be assigned after each chapter read. It may include questions at the end of the chapter or short coding assignments depending on the material. Each will be assigned in Brightspace along with submission instructions. I have designed this course to be **self-contained**. Thus, **the only resources you need to answer the questions are contained within the course**. Searching the web (e.g., Google) for answers is not only *unnecessary* but also risks [academic violations](#academic-violations), which can result in course failure.

### Project

Students will work together in assigned groups on a semester-long project. The project must incorporate the lessons learned from the week's topic. Thus, the project will be done incrementally throughout the semester. However, the project will require the following *each and every week*:

1. A working prototype of the project. This can be as simple as a project skeleton. Be prepared to "throw away" the prototype each week for the first few weeks as your knowledge of the course progresses.
1. Code hosted on our GitHub Classroom.
1. Working tests invoked via continuous integration (CI).

Please inform the instructor if your group requires any computing resources from the Computer Science department to complete your project.

### Presentation

A select number of groups may be asked to present their final projects towards the end of the semester.

## Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments.
- Assignments are the result of **individual effort** unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).

## Exams

Test make-ups will be given if and only if:

- the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
- the make-up is scheduled within three (3) business days following the exam period.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected for *each and every class* meeting. The instructor will start the class on time, and students are expected to be present on time.

## Professional Presence &amp; Communication

A central focus of this course is to simulate the professional work environment of Software Engineers. Thus, every student is expected to present themselves in a professional manner. Students are expected to participate in their group activities under a professional demeanor.

## Academic Violations

The classroom environment employed will be that of a professional one. While students may discuss course materials and assignments with others at a high level, any submitted work must result from *individual* effort *only*. Students are *strongly* advised to read the [resources regarding academic integrity](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/student-affairs/office-of-student-conduct/academic-integrity) provided by Hunter College.

## Email

- Emails to the instructor must be via CUNY email addresses for FERPA reasons.
- Include the *class name* or *number* in the *subject* line of the email.
- Email thread *hijacking* is strongly discouraged. Ensure that the subject of your email matches its contents.
- Ensure that your *correct CUNY* email address is entered into the CUNY Brightspace.

## Bulletin Board

You should check the [Brightspace](http://brightspace.cuny.edu) site regularly since all class material will be posted there. Please make sure you have configured Brightspace to use your *CUNY email address*. You are responsible for any email the instructors might send there.
